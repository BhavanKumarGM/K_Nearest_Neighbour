K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch & Using Scikit-Learn
📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks.

KNN is a lazy, non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions based on the similarity between data points using distance metrics. Unlike many machine learning algorithms, KNN does not build an explicit model during training; instead, it stores the training data and performs computation at prediction time.
